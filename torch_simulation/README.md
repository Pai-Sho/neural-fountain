## neural-fountain PyTorch implementation

A software implementation of the network using the PyTorch deep-learning framework. This is a good way to test the various physical constraints of the system as they become apparent, and develop a realistically buildable architecture for the network.

### TODO

* Add installation guide for os-x/linux
